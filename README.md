# Project #2: React-App-V2

Members Team: Marwa Abdullahi, Novita Hamilton & Cristian Soto


##Overview: 
In this project, your team will embark on the journey of building a dynamic and interactive web application using React. The objective is to create an application within one of four specified domains: Travel Package Booking, Tech Marketplace, Health and Fitness Tracker, or Hobbyist Network. Each member of the team will be responsible for developing one of the key features of the application, ensuring a collaborative effort that leverages the strengths of each team member. This project is an opportunity to apply your React knowledge in a real-world scenario, working as part of a team to build a comprehensive web application. It will challenge you to think critically about application design, component structuring, and collaborative development, all while creating a functional and engaging product.

You and your team will choose one of the following domains for your project:

Travel Package Booking Platform
Tech Marketplace App
Health and Fitness Tracker
Hobbyist Network App
Each domain comes with its own set of unique challenges and key features that need to be implemented. Your team will decide on the component hierarchy and structure of the application, ensuring that each key feature is effectively developed and integrated into the overall application. Each project domain has been carefully chosen to allow you to build a rich project that you can be proud to show future employers! We highly recommend choosing the one that is most interesting to your team, as you'll be spending many hours on it. 

###Responsibilities:
Decide as a team on how the final app will look. It is important to have a unified theme and overall design for all parts of the app. 
Work as a team to identify how each of the features will be interacting with one another. Although each team member will be taking ownership of one key feature, all parts of the app must work seamlessly together.
As a team, decide on the component hierarchy for each feature. You will need to justify your choices, explaining how your chosen structure enhances the application's functionality and user experience.

As a team, decide on what kind of data management your app will need, and set up the Mock API for the app. Since some features require more data than others, ensure to approach the dataset development as a team effort. Optionally, you may explore free APIs to populate your app with data (but will still need to create a Mock API for storing app-specific information). 
Implement your application using React components. Focus on creating reusable components and managing state and props efficiently.
Start with a simple design and basic functionality. Once the foundational aspects of your app are working well, progressively add more complexity and advanced features. Pay attention to the user interface and experience, ensuring that the design is intuitive and user-friendly.

###Expectations:
All code that is submitted is your own. Teammates are encouraged support one another's learning, but do not code on someone else's behalf.
By the end of the project, your team should have a working application in your chosen domain. 
Be prepared to explain the reasoning behind your component hierarchy and the structure of your application.
Use Git for version control throughout the project. Your code should be well-documented and pushed regularly to a shared GitHub repository.
Each team will present their application, showcasing the features and explaining the component architecture, state management, and any challenges encountered.
Notes:

The application may seem daunting at first, with many moving parts! It's okay. Make use of Wireframing and User Stories to break down each feature into small achievable tasks. 
Imagine you are building a real-life application! What would your target user want to be able to do in the application? (Feel free to ask friends and family for ideas! Market research is an important step in app development)
The number of Key Features required for the web app depends on the number of team members in your group (3 or 4). 
Since we haven't covered secure user login and user management in detail yet, the applications will be using minimal user management. As you gain further skills, you will be able to update your webpage to have user-specific accounts!
Your team must utilize GitHub features for collaboration throughout the project.
Remember, a simple app that works is much more valuable than a fancy-looking app with bugs! Start simple and weave in one small addition at a time, ensuring that it works before moving on to another. 

Most importantly: have fun!
Project Option #1: Travel Package Booking Platform
Develop a travel-themed application for creating, browsing, rating and booking travel packages.

###Key Features:
Travel Package Creation: Users can create travel packages, including destination, itinerary, price, accommodations, and tickets available.
Package Browsing: The user can browse existing travel packages that still have seats available, and filter by destinations, durations, ratings or price range.
Package Booking: When a package is selected, the detailed itinerary is shown, along with a list of ratings and reviews of that package. There is an option to book their preferred package (with # of travelers), which will reduce the number of tickets available.
Review System: Users can rate and review the travel packages, using a scale from 1 to 5 stars and a commenting system to add their reviews. Reviews will be added anonymously (due to lack of a user management system)
Project Option #2: Tech Marketplace App
Create a marketplace for buying and selling tech gadgets, such as smartphones, laptops, cameras, and other electronic devices. 

###Key Features:
Product Listings: Users can list their tech gadgets for sale with details like device type, brand, colors, specifications, condition, price, and time on the market.
Product Browsing: Display a list of tech products that are available on the marketplace with details like type, brand, condition, and price. Users should be able to filter based on their preferences.
Product Detail Page: Clicking on a product shows more detailed information, with the option to add an item to cart. Items that are in the user's cart should not exist in the marketplace anymore (due to lack of a secure purchase system)
Device Auction: Users can place a bid for the device and can compete with other users on the price. A device will be sold at it's highest bidding price, unless it is added to a cart at the listed price.   
Project Option #3: Health and Fitness Tracker
Create an application focused on personal health and fitness tracking. This app should allow users to log their daily activities, track nutritional intake, set fitness goals, and monitor progress over time.

###Key Features:
Activity Log: Users can record various physical activities, including the date, duration, intensity, and calories burned. They can also see their past logged activities.
Progress Visualizer: The user can set activity goals for the week (eg total calories burned or total time spent working out). Their progress towards their goal is displayed in a simple chart or visual and should update automatically when new activities are added.  
Nutrition Log: Users can record their dietary intake for each day, along with nutrition and calories. They can also see their past logged meals.
Nutrition Visualizer: The user's daily nutrition info is displayed in a simple chart or visual. The visuals should update automatically when new data is logged for the day 
Project Option #4: Hobbyist Network App
Develop a platform for hobby enthusiasts to share and view content about their hobbies, whether it's in crafts, outdoor activities, technology, cooking, or any other.
Key Features:
Content Sharing: Users can create posts about their experience or progress with a specific hobby. The post will be added to a feed displaying all posts, which users can filter by hobby categories.
Resource Library: Users can create resources for other users. There are two sections, the resource drafts and the resource library. Users can review drafts and rate them; resources with 5 rating and an average rating of 4.5 stars get added to the resource library. 
Hobby Meetups: Users can create an event page to organize a meetup, with details about the hobby type, date, time, location, planned activity, and spaces available. The events should be viewable for all users.
Meetups Sign-up: Users can filter through available events, and select an event they are interested in to view more details about the planned activities. If they want to attend, they can reserve a spot.
